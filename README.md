# EmbedIO Extras

Extras Modules to show how to extend EmbedIO

## Markdown

This Module takes a markdown file and convert it to HTML before to response. It will accept markdown/html/htm extensions.

This could be a middleware later.

## JsonServer

Based [JsonServer's](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) idea, you can set a JSON file as database and use any REST 
method to manipulate it.

Right now just retrieve data, pending implement POST and PUT.
